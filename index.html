        <div class="text1"><p>As a golfer, if I’m looking to book a tee time I have to go through the process of ringing the club to do so. This isn’t as easy as it sounds because a lot of the time they don’t answer or don’t have the time you are looking for on that day. I preferably try to use their website because I can see all the times and what’s available. However, if you are unfamiliar with their website it can be very difficult to navigate and find where you can book a time. It can cause a lot of frustrations and waste a lot of time that we don’t have. First Tee address these problems in an easy to follow app. </p></div>
